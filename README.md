Job search can help you expand your knowledge about required qualities, technologies and opportunies even without attending any interview.

Current job search UX (on sites I check) looks like simplistic text search.

This project should provide backend API that can be used to experiment and build job-specific search features and custom UX.

## Scope of project

This is backend API project. With HTTP as protocol.

CRUD operations for vacancy descriptions.

Search operation with parameters to filter results.

NO site-specific adapters, crawlers, integrations.

```
make build

```

## Run & use instructions

```

Open [application URL](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser. You should see *Hello Gradle!* message.
